            To define it, a solution is a bundle of products and services (and\
            sometimes other solutions) tailored to customer needs. It has\
            countless interdependencies all stemming from the inclusion of the\
            parts that make the whole. To extrapolate: A solution consists of\
            products that are made up of devices, which, in turn, enclose\
            components. These components contain parts, and each part is\
            comprised of pieces such as the billions of transistors in a\
            processor. Transistors capture the state of the machine and the\
            firmware, software, and processes that run on top of it.\
            Additionally, a solution’s direction is defined and influenced by\
            market movements, management decisions, time-sensitive objectives,\
            outbound and inbound escalations, ordering requirements, and\
            support or service offerings.\
