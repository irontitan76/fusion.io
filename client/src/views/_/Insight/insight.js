    <p>Every single developer and architect has their language of choice
    whether its Fortran, A, B, C, C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript or
    any of the countless languages developed by countless individuals
    and companies. They all offer advantages and disadvantages for
    various business needs which, today, must be taken into account
    when architecting an application.</p>

    <p>What about the future — where is at all headed? Will a future
    universal language (or a universal sequence of languages) dismantle
    what’s in the world today? Or will existing languages coalesce into
    one? To answer these questions, I’ll first briefly describe the
    history of the fastest growing languages today — Java and
    JavaScript. Secondly, I’ll contrast the two languages from a
    technical perspective. Lastly, I’ll put forth my argument for
    JavaScript overtaking Java and, crazily enough, potentially becoming
    a part of a universal sequence of languages.</p>

    <h2>The History</h2>

    <p>In 1995, Java - marketed as “a language without boundaries” - left
    the labs at Sun Microsystems and took the world by storm with its
    object-oriented design that merged information and programming to
    make surfing the Web a more dynamic experience. When James Gosling,
    the Father of Java, demoed a virtual molecule flying across the
    screen when hovering his mouse over it within the Java-based
    WebRunner browser, the vision of the dynamic Web was put at the
    forefront of everyone’s mind. In essence, a revolution began.</p>
