   gain, but for the betterment of humanity.\
   \n\n\
   At the present, in this Austin Starbucks Reserve coffee shop I sit in \
   and out in the world, humankind is in a crisis of identity. I look around \
   and I see aimlessness in the eyes of individuals when, instead, \
   there should be vision and vigor. Instead, there should be collaboration \
   and optimization toward something far greater - to the personal \
   freedom for each woman and man. \
   \n\n\
   Technology, like most anything has both a positive and negative \
   effect on society. And like most things, it must be taken in moderation. \
   Fusion Technology is the first organization I will create. It\'s focus \
   is on technology to connect the world we live in with a moral foundation.\
   The organization creates the technological standards that all other \
   organizations under this umbrella will use.\
   \n\n\
   Companies - big and small - have started their journeys wrong. Quickness is necesssary, but\
   it creates a less firm foundation - compromise does not bring about the best \
   ends. It is much like the crisis found in programming. Programming is made \
   up of so many different languages all with various purposes and \
   optimizations. Instead, a universal sequence of langauges from the machine \
   code to the high-level is more optimal where both the hardware and software \
   could more easily be improved. To help build new companies and accelerate \
   transformations of others, Fusion Consulting is the second organization.\
   \n\n\
   Look around. Every media outlet has a bias and each one is manipulating the \
   content they share based off their viewership and ratings instead of what \
   really matters - truth. Since there are no unbiased news organizations, \
   Fusion Media is the third organization. This organization is responsible \
   for spreading the truth with integrity and logic instead of emotion.\
   \n\n\
   Today, wealth is one of many keys to personal freedom. Fusion Finance is the fourth \
   organization and will focus on delivering optimal financial solutions for \
   saving, investing, banking, and planning for both individuals and \
   businesses. It will also focus on the financials for Fusion as a whole.\
